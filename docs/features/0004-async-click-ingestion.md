# Feature: Async Click Ingestion via Outbox → Broker

## Decision

**Owner module**: `clicks` | **Event-coupled**: Y

Forwards `ClickLoggedEvent` to an external broker (`--profile broker`). The type lives in `clicks`. `links` already publishes it from `LinkService` on redirect. `@ApplicationModuleListener` and the JDBC Event Publication Registry (bootstrapped in the seed) already run the click write off the redirect thread. This feature externalises that in-process publication. Consumers are idempotent.

**Traps**: the seed publication is in-process — the broker path is a structural change (the Compose broker profile is a RabbitMQ stub, with AMQP still unwired); broker-down must leave the 307 in place; at-least-once delivery needs idempotency on the consumer (`eventId` already exists for the in-process listeners).

**Technology hints**: Spring Modulith `ApplicationEventPublicationRegistry`; RabbitMQ or Kafka with `--profile broker`; `@TransactionalEventListener(AFTER_COMMIT)`.
