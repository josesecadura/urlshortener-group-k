# Feature cards (agreement)

Seed cards `0001`–`0003` are provided and ignored in the agreement. Teams add **grown** cards from `0004-…` upward.

## How to create a card (October 2)

1. Pick a feature from the [Feature Catalogue](https://moodle.unizar.es/add/mod/resource/view.php?id=12167300), or write a new catalogue entry in the same shape.
2. Copy [`0000-TEMPLATE.md`](0000-TEMPLATE.md) → `NNNN-short-title.md`.
3. Paste the catalogue entry into `## Decision` and choose a **weight** (5, 8, 13, or 21).
4. Leave `## Later` empty — fill it before the feature is graded.
5. Link the card in [`AGREEMENT.md`](../../AGREEMENT.md).

Personal names and ownership belong in your local `TEAM.md` (git-ignored), not in the card.

## Rules (locked)

- Weight ∈ {**5, 8, 13, 21**} (Fibonacci = ExpectedLevel 1–4)
- **Σ weights = 84** (spend the full budget)
- **≥ 4** grown features (one per member of a team of 4); **≥ 2** event-coupled
- One card per file: `NNNN-short-title.md`
- Owner module must match `AGENTS.md` (or a new module + ADR)
- ADR only when the feature **locks** a decision — see [`../adr/README.md`](../adr/README.md)
- **AI disclosure** and **`./gradlew check` green** are required before grading (not for the agreement)
