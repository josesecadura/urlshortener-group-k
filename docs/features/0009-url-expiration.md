# Feature: URL Expiration

## Decision

**Owner module**: `links` | **Event-coupled**: N (self-contained in links; event coupling only needed at Level 3+ when another module must react to expiry)

Users optionally set an expiration date/time at creation. Accesses after expiry return 410 Gone via Problem Detail. Background sweep deletes or deactivates expired rows.

**Traps**: the sweep runs N times on N replicas with a naive `@Scheduled` — requires a DB-level lock (ShedLock) or leader election to ensure single execution. Claiming Level 3 (weight 13) requires a new event of your own. Adding `expiresAt` to `ShortUrlCreatedEvent` reuses the seed event and does not count.

**Technology hints**: `@Scheduled` + ShedLock; `@Future` Bean Validation; soft-delete pattern.
