# Feature: Redirect Cache with Cross-Replica Invalidation

## Decision

**Owner module**: `links` | **Event-coupled**: Y

Caches hash → target in a shared store. When a URL is deactivated or deleted, a `ShortUrlUpdatedEvent` triggers cache invalidation across all replicas.

**Traps**: an in-process `@Cacheable` is not shared across replicas — clients get stale targets from the non-invalidating replica; TTL-only eviction doesn’t satisfy the Level 4 bar.

**Technology hints**: Redis EXPIRE + pub/sub invalidation; Spring Cache with `RedisCacheManager`; event-driven invalidation subscriber.
