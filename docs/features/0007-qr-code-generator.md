# Feature: QR Code Generation

## Decision

**Owner module**: `links` | **Event-coupled**: N

Generates a QR code PNG (or SVG) for any shortened URL on demand via content negotiation (`Accept: image/png`). Optionally embedded as a Base64 field in the creation response.

**Traps**: large QR payloads generated synchronously on every redirect poll; content negotiation conflicts with other features that extend the creation response; image format mismatch between on-the-fly generation and cached responses.

**Technology hints**: ZXing (core + javase); `@RequestMapping(produces = "image/png")`; Spring `StreamingResponseBody` for large images.
